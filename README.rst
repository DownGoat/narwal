narwal
======

narwal (sic) is a Python wrapper for reddit's API made to be simple, intuitive,
and concise.

The goal is to make using narwal as easy as navigating reddit on a browser.


Installation
------------

To install: ::

    $ pip install narwal


Examples (until better docs are written)
----------------------------------------

Start a session and get the front page, and the next:

    >>> import narwal
    >>> session = narwal.connect(user_agent='narwal demo')
    >>> page1 = session.hot()
    >>> for link in page1:
    ...   print link
    ...

    (1830) I'm no longer a 23 year old virgin! Awww Yeah!!!
    (2086) The Most Irritating Software in the World
    ...
    >>> page2 = page1.more()
    >>> print page2
    [<Link [(966) Please tell me ...]>, <Link [(1100) Chubby arctic ...]>, ...]

Get the fourth link's comments:
    
    >>> comments = page1[3].comments()
    >>> for c in comments[:3]:
    ...   print c
    ...

Log in and comment on second link of r/test/top, downvote it, then reply to it:

    >>> session.login('narwal_bot', 'password')
    >>> link = session.top('test')[1]
    >>> comment = link.comment('the narwhal ba--')
    >>> comment.downvote()
    <Response [200]>
    >>> comment.reply('NO! *slap*')
    <Comment [(1) narwal_bot: NO! *slap*]>

Check inbox, read first unread message, get sender's account info and 
submissions:

    >>> inbox = session.inbox()
    >>> len(inbox)
    3
    >>> print inbox[0]
    larryng: hi there
    >>> user = session.user(message.author)
    >>> user
    <Account [larryng]>
    >>> user.submitted()
    [<Link [(1) test post please ...]>]

Plus a whole lot more, as most of the reddit API has been implemented.  Please
see the source for more info while I'm working on the docs.
